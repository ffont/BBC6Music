iOS, tvOS and OSX apps for listening to the BBC6

Because I don't live in the UK and the BBC makes it difficult to use their apps (aka iPlayer) to listen to the radios etc, I made my own. Also this was an excuse to learn a bit of Swift.

So what you'll find in this xcode project are apps for listening to the BBC 6Music in iOS,tvOS and OSX devices/laptops.
All apps allow you to listen to the radio but also display metadata about the currently played track/artist (retreived from BBC sites). The OSX app sits in the menu bar ;), iOS and tvOS are standard single-screen things. These only have been tested in iOS/tvOS 9.0-9.2 and OSX 10.11. iOS app should adapt iPads in landscape mode and iPhones in portrait mode, although the layout is **really ugly**. Well to the three apps are quite ugly, buggy and hacky, but I use them almost daily and they do the job :)

Hope someone can find this useful!
